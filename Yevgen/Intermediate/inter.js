/* Classes - Intermediate
   Ex 1

Now you will extend the classes from the previous exercise. 
Car: Extend with a child class called Motorbike, that will inherit the property and methods from the parent Class, as well as create new properties and methods that are unique to this class. Example: number of wheels.

Animal: Extend with a child class called Fish, that will inherit the property and methods from the parent Class, as well as create new properties and methods that are unique to this class. Example: type of water it inhabits.

Person: Extend with a child class called Profession, that will inherit the property and methods from the parent Class, as well as create new properties and methods that are unique to this class. Example: job position.

Create, using the Child classes, 3 different objects for each class.
The results from the methods must be printed on the browser too.

// Classes - Basic
// Ex 1
/*
Create 3 different classes:  car, animal and person. These classes should have some properties like name, brand, model, type, color, weight, age... of course inherent to its type because, for instance, an animal has no brand... 

Each class should have at least one method, that shows some properties about each theme. Feel free to expand on that.

Create, using the classes, 3 different objects for each class.

The results from the methods must be printed on the browser too.
